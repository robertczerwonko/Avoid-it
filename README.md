## Game rules #
You have to pick one character, in demo it's just simple human face (player is scriptable object, so it can be easily edited)
1. Each character has original item to collect and must avoid other items. (In background always is seen your item to collect)
  - For collecting correct item, you are getting points
2. Controller is inspired by joystic 
  - By holding and draging finger on screen you simulate character movement
  - You can tap anywhere on screen to move
